For my assignment, i built a web app that allows users check the conversion rate between three currencies namely US dollars, Pounds and Euros. To use this app, you first of all choose between two of the three currencies you want to get the rates to then you type in the ammount you want to be converted. Languages used are HTML, CSS and Javascript API used https://app.exchangerate-api.com/sign-up To deploy my web app. i embedded the html, css and javascript codes into my web-01 and web-02 by typing this command "var/www/html" afer installling and startinh ngnix then i created my three files which are HTML, CSS and Javascript then i copied the contents from my code editor and pasted it in the files i created and restarted ngnix then my code became visible on the browser. I faced many challenges but the main challenge i faced was the different APIs i used did not work. i tried up to 15 different APIs from Rapid API but they did not work so i reulted to another API site.
